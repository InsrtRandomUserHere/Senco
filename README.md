# Senco

What is Senco? Well, Senco is just a quick project I made to help me when writing essays that has a sentence count threshold.<br><br>
Senco stands for "Sentence Counter", which is what it was originally intended to do. <br>
Senco also counts real-time raw characters, words, \*sentences (just counting periods), paragraphs, and line counts.
